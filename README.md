# What is This?

This is a simple template that sets up the following:

- `vue 3`
- `tailwindcss`
- `typescript`

# Why is This?

So that I don't have to spend 3 minutes setting up tailwind and deleting vite boilerplate everytime I want to prototype some shit.

# How?

Just `git clone` this repo and run `yarn` it should work, else come and find me.
